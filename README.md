# Design Patterns in Java

This repository contains simple implementations of common design patterns in Java. Each pattern is implemented in its own file for clarity and learning purposes.

## Contents

- **Factory Pattern** (`Factory_Pattern`)
- **Strategy Pattern** (`Strategy_Pattern`)
- **Observer Pattern** (`Observer_Pattern`)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Rishabhy190/Design_Patterns.git
   cd Design_Patterns
   ```
2. Compile the desired pattern file. For example, to run the Factory Pattern:
   ```sh
   javac Factory_Pattern
   java Factory_Pattern
   ```
   > For other patterns, replace `Factory_Pattern` with the respective file name.

## Pattern Descriptions

### Factory Pattern
Demonstrates object creation logic encapsulated in a factory class. Run `Factory_Pattern` to see how different vehicle objects are created and used via a common interface.

### Strategy Pattern
(Implementation placeholder) Demonstrates how to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.

### Observer Pattern
(Implementation placeholder) Shows how objects (observers) can subscribe to and receive updates from another object (subject).
